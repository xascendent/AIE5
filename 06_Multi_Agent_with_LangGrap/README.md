In today's assignment, we'll be creating a MULTI-Agentic LangGraph Application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1:
  1. Simple LCEL RAG
  2. Helper Functions for Agent Graphs
  3. Research Team - A LangGraph for Researching A Specific Topic
  
- 🤝 Breakout Room #2:
  1. Document Writing Team - A LangGraph for Writing, Editing, and Planning a LinkedIn post.
  2. Meta-Supervisor and Full Graph
