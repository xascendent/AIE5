It is particularly useful when dealing with complex interactions, as it allows for chaining operations and defining conditions systematically.\\n\\nSome key aspects of LECL include:\\n\\n1. **Expressiveness**: Users can write high-level expressions to define complex operations on the data, making it easier to formulate queries without needing to write extensive and low-level code.\\n\\n2. **Integration**: LECL is designed to work seamlessly with the capabilities of the LangChain framework and integrates well with various data sources and models.\\n\\n3. **Data Pipelines**: It is useful for constructing data processing pipelines that involve steps such as data transformation, filtering, and aggregation, especially in the context of language understanding.\\n\\n4. **Flexibility**: LECL allows users to combine different types of operations, which means it can cater to a wide range of use cases, from simple queries to complex data analyses involving natural language processing.\\n\\nOverall, LECL is aimed at making it easier for developers and data scientists to leverage language models in their applications by providing a powerful and intuitive way to express and execute queries and transformations.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 297, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 324, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_72ed7ab54c', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-4c002aa8-3fa6-448f-b7c5-246ce63227da-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 297, 'total_tokens': 324, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}\n"

        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",

        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",

        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",

        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

Additionally, LCEL allows for graceful error handling through the use of fallbacks and enables parallel execution of components that can run simultaneously, which is beneficial given that many LLM applications involve lengthy API calls.'"
