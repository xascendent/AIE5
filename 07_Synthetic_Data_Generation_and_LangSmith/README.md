In today's assignment, we'll be creating Synthetic Data, and using it to benchmark (and improve) a LCEL RAG Chain.

- 🤝 BREAKOUT ROOM #1
  1. Use RAGAS to Generate Synthetic Data

- 🤝 BREAKOUT ROOM #2
  1. Load them into a LangSmith Dataset
  2. Evaluate our RAG chain against the synthetic test data
  3. Make changes to our pipeline
  4. Evaluate the modified pipeline

## Ship 🚢

The completed notebook!

#### 🏗️ BONUS ACTIVITY (FULL MARKS IF COMPLETED IN LIEU OF ABOVE NOTEBOOK):

Reproduce the RAGAS Synthetic Data Generation Steps - but utilize a LangGraph Agent Graph, instead of the Knowledge Graph approach.

This generation should leverage the [Evol Instruct](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12244) method to generate synthetic data.

Your final state (output) should contain (at least, not limited to):

1. `List(dict)`: Evolved Questions, their IDs, and their Evolution Type.
2. `List(dict)`: Question IDs, and Answer to the referenced Evolved Question.
3. `List(dict)`: Question IDs, and the relevant Context(s) to the Evolved Question.

The Graph should handle:

1. Simple Evolution.
2. Multi-Context Evolution.
3. Reasoning Evolution.

It should take, as input, a list of LangChain Documents.
