In today's assignment, we'll be creating an Agentic LangChain RAG Application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1:
  1. Install required libraries
  2. Set Environment Variables
  3. Creating our Tool Belt
  4. Creating Our State
  5. Creating and Compiling A Graph!
  
- 🤝 Breakout Room #2:
  - Part 1: LangSmith Evaluator:
    1. Creating an Evaluation Dataset
    2. Adding Evaluators
  - Part 2:
    3. Adding Helpfulness Check and "Loop" Limits
    4. LangGraph for the "Patterns" of GenAI

🚀 Exciting News! 🚀

I am thrilled to announce that I have just built and shipped an Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation Application with LangChain! 🎉🤖

🔍 Three Key Takeaways:
1️⃣  I learned LangSmith allows for me to debug parts of my tools by reviewing findings in a website
2️⃣  I learned more about how Nodes operation using LangChain and expressions
3️⃣  I learned about two new tools that we added to our tool belt that I didn't know existed one queries google, and the other looksup documents online

Let's continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of AI and question-answering. Here's to many more innovations! 🚀
