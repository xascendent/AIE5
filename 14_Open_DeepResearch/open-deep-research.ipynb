    "\n",
    "- **Report-Level State:**  \n",
    "  - **Topic:** The overall subject of the report.  \n",
    "  - **Feedback on Report Plan:** Comments or evaluations on the preliminary report outline.  \n",
    "  - **Sections:** A list of individual report sections (each with its own name, description, whether research is needed, and content).  \n",
    "  - **Completed Sections:** A collection of sections that have been fully developed, which is also used by downstream processes (e.g., a Send() API).  \n",
    "  - **Research-Based Content:** A string that gathers content produced from web research, which may be integrated into the final report.  \n",
    "  - **Final Report:** The completed report after all sections and revisions are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Section-Level State:**  \n",

    "  - **Section Details:** Including the section’s name, a brief overview (description), a flag indicating if web research should be performed, and the actual content.  \n",
    "  - **Search Process:** The number of search iterations that have been executed and a list of search queries used to gather information.  \n",
    "  - **Source Content:** A formatted string containing the relevant material obtained from web searches.  \n",
    "  - **Integration:** Both the research-derived content and the list of fully completed sections are tracked to ensure they can be merged into the overall report.\n",

    "- **Search Queries and Feedback:**  \n",
    "  - **Search Queries:** Represented as individual query objects, these encapsulate the strings used to perform web searches.  \n",
    "  - **Feedback:** After generating parts of the report, feedback is provided as a grade (either \"pass\" or \"fail\") along with any follow-up queries to improve the work."

    "## Report Planner and Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a configuration system for a chatbot that generates reports. Here's a breakdown of its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default Report Structure:**  \n",
    "   A multi-line string provides a template for creating reports. It suggests starting with an introduction that gives an overview of the topic, then dividing the main content into sections focused on sub-topics, and finally ending with a conclusion that summarizes the main points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enumerated Types (Enums):**  \n",
    "   - **SearchAPI:** Lists possible search services (like PERPLEXITY, TAVILY, EXA, ARXIV, and PUBMED) that the chatbot might use to gather information.\n",
    "   - **PlannerProvider & WriterProvider:** These define options for external service providers that handle planning (organizing the report structure) and writing (generating the text). Options include providers like ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, and GROQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuration Data Class:**  \n",
    "   The `Configuration` class holds various settings for the chatbot. Key attributes include:\n",
    "   - **report_structure:** Uses the default report template.\n",
    "   - **number_of_queries:** Specifies how many search queries should be generated in each iteration (default is 2).\n",
    "   - **max_search_depth:** Sets the limit for how many times the chatbot can iterate through reflection and search (default is 2).\n",
    "   - **planner_provider & planner_model:** Determine which external service and model to use for planning the report.\n",
    "   - **writer_provider & writer_model:** Specify the external service and model for generating the report text.\n",
    "   - **search_api & search_api_config:** Indicate which search API to use (defaulting to TAVILY) and allow for additional API configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configuration Initialization Method:**  \n",
    "   The class method `from_runnable_config` allows the configuration to be created from a provided configuration object (or from environment variables). It checks for values in the environment (using uppercase names) and from a passed configuration dictionary. Only fields with provided values are used to instantiate the `Configuration` object."

Its architecture incorporates multi-head latent attention (MLA) to optimize the attention mechanism and reduce memory overhead during inference.\\n\\nDeepSeek-R1's training methodology combines four distinct phases:\\n\\n* Initial cold start phase (2 weeks) for basic language comprehension\\n* Primary RL phase (8 weeks) for reasoning capability development\\n* Rejection sampling phase (4 weeks) for output quality refinement\\n* Final supervised fine-tuning for specialized capabilities\\n\\nThis hybrid approach has resulted in impressive benchmark performances, including 90.8% on MMLU, 84% on MMLU-Pro, and 71.5% on GPQA, demonstrating strong reasoning capabilities across diverse domains.\\n\\n### Sources\\n- DeepSeek's DeepSeek-R1 - AI Model Details: https://docsbot.ai/models/deepseek-r1\\n- How DeepSeek-R1 Was Built: Architecture and Training Explained: https://blog.adyog.com/2025/02/01/how-deepseek-r1-was-built-architecture-and-training-explained/\\n- Exploring DeepSeek-R1's Mixture-of-Experts Model Architecture: https://www.modular.com/ai-resources/exploring-deepseek-r1-s-mixture-of-experts-model-architecture\")]}}\n",

The API supports both synchronous and streaming responses, with example code available in Python and Node.js. A typical integration follows this pattern:\\n\\n* Authentication setup using API keys\\n* Model selection (deepseek-chat for V3 or deepseek-reasoner for R1)\\n* Environment configuration for secure credential management\\n* Response handling setup for streaming or batch processing\\n\\nThe pricing structure operates on a per-token basis, with different rates for input and output tokens.

       "## Impact on Open-Source AI Development\n",
       "\n",
       "**DeepSeek-R1's open-source release represents a pivotal shift in AI development, demonstrating that high-performance models can be built for approximately 95% lower cost than proprietary alternatives while maintaining competitive capabilities.**\n",
       "\n",
       "The model's MIT license enables broad access and modification rights, fostering rapid innovation through community collaboration. This is evidenced by the emergence of over 1,000 derivative models on HuggingFace within days of release, showcasing unprecedented speed of iteration and improvement.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, this openness introduces significant security considerations. The model's architecture requires enabling trust_remote_code, creating potential vulnerabilities. Security researchers have identified critical flaws, including susceptibility to jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks that bypass safety controls.\n",
       "\n",
       "Key implications for the AI ecosystem include:\n",
       "- Democratized access to frontier AI capabilities\n",
       "- Accelerated innovation through collaborative development\n",
       "- Increased security risks requiring robust safeguards\n",
       "- Pressure on proprietary model pricing and business models\n",
       "- Need for balanced regulation supporting both innovation and safety\n",
